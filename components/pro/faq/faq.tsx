                We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
                growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
                express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity
                to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of
                people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.

                It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
                is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
                offended by it, it doesn't matter. Because it's about motivating the
                doers. Because I'm here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to
                follow their dreams, too.

                The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun
                people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But
                the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in
                what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed it? If
                everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just
                the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so
                scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing people can't
                say is that I'm not trying, and I'm not trying my hardest, and I'm not
                trying to do the best way I know how.
