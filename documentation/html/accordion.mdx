# Tailwind CSS Accordion

Use our Tailwind CSS accordion component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile accordion example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some accordion props that are available.

To use an accordion example that has items expanded, add the <Code html html>.open</Code> class on the <Code html html>.collapse</Code> `<div>`.

            We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
            growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
            express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity
            to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of
            people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.

            It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
            is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
            offended by it, it doesn't matter. Because it's about motivating the
            doers. Because I'm here to follow my dreams and inspire other people
            to follow their dreams, too.

            The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world
            shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing
            out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you
            believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed
            it? If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually
            succeeds - just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration.
            People are so scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing
            people can't say is that I'm not trying, and I'm not trying my
            hardest, and I'm not trying to do the best way I know how.

## Required Scrips

<span id="required-script" className="scroll-mt-56" />

The accordion component needs a required script file to work, you just need to add the below script file to the bottom of your html file.

```html
<!-- from node_modules -->
<script src="node_modules/@material-tailwind/html/scripts/collapse.js"></script>

<!-- from cdn -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@material-tailwind/html@latest/scripts/collapse.js"></script>
```
