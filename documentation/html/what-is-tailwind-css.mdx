# What is Tailwind CSS

A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

<br />
<br />

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

<br />
<br />

##### Responsive to the core

Every Tailwind utility also comes with responsive variants, making it extremely easy to build responsive interfaces without resorting to custom CSS.

<br />
Tailwind uses an intuitive screen: prefix that makes it easy to notice responsive
classes in your markup while keeping the original class name recognizable and intact.
<br />

##### Component-friendly

While you can do a lot with just utility classes, as a project grows it can be useful to codify common patterns into higher level abstractions.

<br />
Tailwind provides tools for extracting component classes from repeated utility patterns,
making it easy to update multiple instances of a component from one place.
<br />

##### Designed to be customized

If it makes sense to be customizable, Tailwind lets you customize it. This includes colors, border sizes, font weights, spacing utilities, breakpoints, shadows, and tons more.

<br />
Tailwind is written in PostCSS and configured in JavaScript, which means you have
the full power of a real programming language at your fingertips.
<br />
Tailwind is more than a CSS framework, itâ€™s an engine for creating design systems.
<br />

##### A simple Tailwind CSS Component

Here is a small stats card sample code:

```html showLineNumbers
<a href="javascript:;" class="avatar">
  <img
    alt="Image placeholder"

  />
</a>
```
