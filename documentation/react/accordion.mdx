# Tailwind CSS Accordion - React

Use our Tailwind CSS accordion component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile accordion example that you can use in your React and Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some accordion props that are available.

            onClick={() => setState((s) => ({ active: active === 1 ? 0 : 1 }))}
