```

---

## Using Yarn

```

<span id="pnpm" className="scroll-mt-48" />

```bash

```

## TailwindCSS Configurations

<span id="tailwindcss-config" className="scroll-mt-48" />

Once you install @material-tailwind/react you need to wrap your tailwind css configurations with the <Code>withMT()</Code> function coming from @material-tailwind/react/utils.

```js {1, 3, 9}
const withMT = require("@material-tailwind/react/utils/withMT");

module.exports = withMT({
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
});
```

---

## Theme Provider

<span id="theme-provider" className="scroll-mt-48" />

@material-tailwind/react comes with a theme provider that set's the default theme/styles for components or to provide your own theme/styles to your components. You need to wrap your entire application with the <Code>ThemeProvider</Code> coming from @material-tailwind/react.

On the <Code>src/index</Code> put the code bellow.

```jsx {6, 12, 14}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

import { ThemeProvider } from "@material-tailwind/react";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## Example

Now you're good to go and use @material-tailwind/react in your project.

<ComponentDemo id="example">
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ComponentDemo>

```jsx showLineNumbers {1, 4}
import { Button } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>;
}
```
