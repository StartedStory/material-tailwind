```js {1, 3, 9}
const withMT = require("@material-tailwind/react");

module.exports = withMT({
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {

  },
  plugins: []
});

```jsx {4, 7, 9}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "App";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@material-tailwind/react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
