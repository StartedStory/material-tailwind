# Tailwind CSS Tabs - React

Get started on your web project with our responsive Tailwind CSS <Code>Tabs</Code> that create a secondary navigational hierarchy for your website.

<Code>Tabs</Code> are components that render and display subsections to users. They
arrange the content into categories for easy access and a cleaner-looking app.

See below our example that will help you create a simple and easy-to-use <Code>Tabs</Code> for your Tailwind CSS and React project.

You can use tailwind css classes for customizing the tabs components, see the example below for an underline tabs component.

<CodePreview id="underline-tabs" link="tabs#underline-tabs" component={
  <State initialState={{ activeTab: "html" }}>
    <Observe>
      {({ setState, activeTab }) => (
        <Tabs id="underline-tabs-component" value={activeTab}>
          <TabsHeader
            className="bg-transparent rounded-none border-b border-blue-gray-50 p-0"
            indicatorProps={{
              className: "bg-transparent border-b-2 border-blue-500 shadow-none rounded-none",
            }}
          >
            <Tab
              value="html"
              onClick={() => setState((s) => ({ activeTab: "html" }))}
              className={activeTab === "html" ? "text-blue-500" : ""}
            >
              HTML
