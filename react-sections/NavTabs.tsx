          matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are
          like offended by it, it doesn&apos;t matter. Because it&apos;s about
          motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to follow my dreams and

          people are controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves!

          anything. I was taught I could do everything.
